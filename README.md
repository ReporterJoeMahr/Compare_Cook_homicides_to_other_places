# How does Cook County compare to other places?
## by Joe Mahr/ Chicago Tribune

This is part of a series of data crunching the Chicago Tribune has done on court delays in Cook County. This analysis looks at how Cook County compares to other places in a specific measurement: the percent of homicide cases concluded in one year. This dovetails from an earlier analysis called Cook_murder_case_length. For a deeper explanation of the state's attorney data, please refer to that.

I've included an R project file (Comparing_Cook_to_other_places) that walks you through the code. There's also rmd and html versions, if you prefer. It may simply be easier to download a zip file of this entire repository and work from your computer. (Side note: I'm a relative Github newbie, so I may be making rookie mistakes in how I upload these files. Apologies in advance.)

### **Getting the data**
This is all explained in the project, rmd and html files, but a quick recap.

The biggest thing is getting the raw data. Github doesn't allow hosting huge datasets -- and these are huge. I've stuggled finding ways to finagle them through Large File Storage. So you'll need to create a folder called raw_data in your working directory, and then put four files in there. You can download all four files from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g0jRnpb-BN4c7S9k0_lmv_aKu7UjFL0h?usp=share_link).

### **Preparing/ crunching the data**

Again, there's more detail in the actual project, rmd and html files, but the gist is to first crunch the NCSC data, and then crunch the Cook County data. Note that we're talking homicides -- which is a broader category than murder. 

If you'd prefer just to skip to the good stuff, there's a Final_data folder with -- you guessed it -- the final data.
